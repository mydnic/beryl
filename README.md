## Installation

### Docker Installation (Single Container)

This is the easiest way to get Beryl up and running. No need to clone the repository or manage source code.

#### Prerequisites
- Docker installed on your system
- A folder containing your music files

#### Installation Steps

1. Create a directory for Beryl (optional):

```bash
mkdir beryl && cd beryl
```

2. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file with the following content:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  beryl:
    image: mydnic/beryl:latest
    container_name: beryl
    ports:
      - "8000:80"
    volumes:
      - /path/to/your/music:/music   # Change this to your music folder
      - beryl_storage:/var/www/storage
      - beryl_bootstrap:/var/www/bootstrap/cache
    environment:
      - MUSIC_PATH=/music
      - APP_ENV=production
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  beryl_storage:
  beryl_bootstrap:
```

3. Edit the `docker-compose.yml` file to set the correct path for your music folder.

4. Start the application:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

5. Access Beryl at http://localhost:8000

#### Updating Beryl

To update to the latest version of Beryl:

```bash
docker compose pull
```

### Advanced: Using a Different Database

By default, Beryl uses SQLite for easy self-hosting. If you want to use PostgreSQL, set the relevant environment variables in your `.env` file and mount your own database.

## Configuration

### Music Library

Beryl needs access to your music files. During installation, you'll need to configure the path to your music folder in the docker-compose.yml file. This folder should contain your music files organized in any structure you prefer.

Supported audio formats:
- MP3
- FLAC
- M4A
- WAV
- OGG
- AAC
- WMA
- AIFF
- ALAC

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables can be customized in your docker-compose.yml file:

- `DB_DATABASE`: Database name (default: beryl)
- `DB_USERNAME`: Database username (default: beryl)
- `DB_PASSWORD`: Database password
- `MUSIC_PATH`: Path to your music folder
- `HTTP_PORT`: The port for the web interface (default: 8000)
- `REVERB_PORT`: The port for WebSocket connections (default: 8080)

## Usage

### Scanning Your Music Library

1. Log in to Beryl
2. Navigate to the Music section
3. Click "Scan Library"

The scanning process will run in the background. For large libraries, this may take some time.

### Streaming Music

Once your library is scanned, you can browse and play your music directly in the web interface.
