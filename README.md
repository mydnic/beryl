Supported audio formats:
- MP3
- FLAC
- M4A
- WAV
- OGG
- AAC
- WMA
- AIFF
- ALAC

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables can be customized in your `.env` file:

- `DB_DATABASE`: Database name (default: beryl)
- `DB_USERNAME`: Database username (default: beryl)
- `DB_PASSWORD`: Database password
- `APP_URL`: The URL where Beryl will be accessible (default: http://localhost:8000)
- `HTTP_PORT`: The port for the web interface (default: 8000)

## Usage

### Scanning Your Music Library
